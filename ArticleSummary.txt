Reading the data version control article has broadened my perspective.
While I previoiusly only thought of version control from a personal software development
perspective, I never thought about how data professional use different branches to create
isolated testing environments and allow for data governance. Making ETL pipelines was something
I got into this summer, and from this article, I realized I need to version more frequeuntly to
help identify errors when something goes wrong.
